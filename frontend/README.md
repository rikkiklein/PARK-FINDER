Emergency Doc

Emergency Doc is an application made for people who cannot afford healthcare and live in New York. The API's that we are using are NYC Open Data and GoogleMaps. We begin by first locating the user then there is a button called Find Hospital, this button will then find hospitals in a 5 mile radius. The map uses the latitude and longitude coordinates to display the results in the area.

The user will then be able to add a comment, and leave feedback about the hospital and the type of service they got and be able to update that information. The cards displayed show contact information and hours of operation.
